Dear Website owner,

if you protect or just hide your web-server IP using Cloudflare, please ask yourself these 3 questions:

- Do you respect privacy of your online visitors?
- Do you want to make the Internet a better place?
- Are you a wise person in general?

If **YES**, please consider allowing Tor users to visit your site.

By default, Cloudflare force Tor users to solve Google reCaptcha - the all-in-one evil of the nowadays Internet, which ruins any user experience and demotivates one to use the Internet once forever.

If you don't want your Tor users to struggle that fate, please make a few easy steps in your Cloudflare account described below.

Log-in to your Cloudflare account right now and select your site's domain, then:

1. Click on '**Firewall**' button

2. Go into '**Firewall Rules**' tab

3. Click button '**Create a Firewall rule**'

6. Select '**equals**' under the _Operator_ selectbox
7. Select '**Tor**' under the _value_ selectbox

8. Choose '**Allow**' in the 'Choose an action' selectbox

9. Click '**Deploy**' button

Thank you very much for supporting the Tor users community and the Internet privacy!
